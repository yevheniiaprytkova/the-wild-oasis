# The Wild Oasis

This project I build while learning React + Vite with this course ( https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course). 

This is an internal hotel management app that completely hide under the login, so all routes can be reached only by authorized people. As this is just learning app, you can fill login fields with data below and see what is inside.

After login you can see dashboard and side navigation to all pages: cabins, bookings, users and settings, also you can switch whole app to dark mode. If dashboard is clear just click on 'upload bookings only' and you will see graphs and current activity. 

To create databases for all of them, we choose Supabase and read them in React using React Query, for styling we used styled-components. Render the whole app using React and deployed on Vercel.
